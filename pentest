Microsoft Azure pen-testing hands-on experience with the implementation of firewall, subnets, NSGs, and Azure Policy. 

#Firewall scrutinizes all inbound and outbound traffic, effectively safeguarding the network against unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

#subnets implemented to segregate various types of traffic and resources.  

subnet 1 may accommodate web servers 

subnet 2 for database servers

subnet 3 for development servers, ensuring the protection of each resource from one another and from external threats.

#NSGs assigned to each subnet to govern the permitted traffic to and from the #VMs within that subnet

#Vnet functions as a virtual data center within Azure, ensuring that testing environment is separate from the production network.

Azure #resource #groups serve as a logical container for managing and organizing associated resources

Azure #Security #Center is used for delivering real-time threat intelligence and offering proactive security suggestions.

Microsoft #Sentinel and #Log #Analytics collect and analyze logs in one place, helping effectively identify and respond to security incidents.

Azure #Security #Policies ensure that specific security requirements are met and assist in adhering to industry best practices.
